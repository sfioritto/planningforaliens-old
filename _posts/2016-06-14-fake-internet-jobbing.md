I run my own business, I sell things to customers for money, sometimes
my time or expertise, sometimes an actual product, and then I
pay my mortgage with the profits. What a concept, right?

I've started to tell people I have a "fake internet job"
because "entrepreneur" and "tech startup" are totally overloaded words
now that have nothing to do with what I do for a living.

It's lonely having a fake internet job. Over the years, it's been
incredibly difficult to find people like me. I've put together a small
network of friends now, and I've discovered that having a community of
friends has unexpected benefits. I almost always have someone I can
talk to when I run into a problem that has dealt with it
before. Spontaneous collaboration opportunities present themselves to
me more and more often. My business has grown in ways I could not have
predicted.

### And I don't feel alone anymore.

My fake internet job friends are mostly online. We talk on Slack or
video chat. It's fine but I want that HERE, in Chicago where we
actually live and can shake hands.

This is the City of the Big Shoulders. Our factories fed a nation beef
for generations. We raised the entire center of the city one building
at a time with hydraulic jacks so the city could drain properly. We
invented the skyscraper and reversed the flow of the Chicago river.

You and I, we've carved out our own little fake internet jobs from
nothing. We contribute in our own small way to that ethos, but we're
completely disconnected from our own city.

Now imagine a community of people like you and me, working together in
the same place, getting shit done, making money, making friends, and
building a new Chicago on OUR big shoulders.

Right now you're probably sitting in a coffee shop or at your home
office, or maybe you're renting a desk from a coworking space.

I rent a coworking space, but we barely know each other. It's because
I'm renting a space, not participating in a community. There's no way
that spontaneous collaboration will ever happen there. Nothing
surprising could ever come out of that place, and it only makes me feel
a little less lonely.

I'm done with that. I want people like YOU working next to me. I want
to feel like I'm a part of Chicago, not some weirdo outsider with a
fake internet job surfing from coffee shop to coffee shop.

About two months ago, I got an email from <a
href="https://twitter.com/TheVisionfairy">Monica Guzman</a>. She
wanted to meet and talk shop about consulting. So we got together for
coffee, and while we were talking she mentioned that as a freelancer,
she felt isolated, and that she wanted to be a part of a
community. She said that she was trying to start a coworking space,
but that really what she wanted was a community, and that the space
wasn't that important.

Of course I immediately said I want to help! Because that is exactly
how I feel.

So what's next, what's the next step? How do we make this happen?

The next step is for us to meet! You have two options:

1. Email me or Monica and we get together for coffee:
   sean@planningforaliens.com, monica.v.guzman@gmail.com.
2. Join Monica and me and your fellow fake-internet-jobbers at this fun event,
   scheduled during hours only people with fake internet jobs could
   make. [Click right here to join the meetup](http://www.meetup.com/imposterati/).

###Captain's Log: Entry #1

I have returned to Palos with gold. When we discovered the hidden cache of treasure I ordered my men to load up as much as possible. We could only bring back a small sample of the treasure on the small ship I had commissioned for this journey. Fortunately the sample I brought back was enough to lure several investors into another journey and I am now flush with cash ready to burn on a bigger ship and professional sailors.

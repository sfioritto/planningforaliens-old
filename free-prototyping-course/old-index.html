<h2 class="first">"Designing in the browser" is really hard. Seriously.</h2>

<p>
  It's one thing to know how to build a website, it's another thing
  entirely to sit down and design a website <em>while writing code.</em>
</p>

<p>
  It's impossible to keep your mind thinking about the design when every
  few minutes you're diving into the docs for whatever grid system you
  decided to use.
</p>

<div class="creative">
  <p>
    You can't be creative ...
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ... AND worry about performance
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ... AND write maintainable code
  </p>
  
  <p>
    ... AND worry about cross-browser compatibility.
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  It's not possible and it's not even a good idea.
</p>

<h2>
  There's no such thing as a Unicorn.

<p>
  You can't be both an expert designer and an expert developer. Both
  fields are too vast. 
</p>
<p>
  So "designing in the browser" is out of reach for mere mortals,
  right?
</p>
<p>
NOPE!
</p>
<h3>
  You don't have to be a Jedi master at front-end dev to be amazingly
  fast at creating prototypes!
</h3>

<p>
  The skills you need for rapid prototyping are only a teeny, tiny subset of the much, much
  bigger front-end developer pie.

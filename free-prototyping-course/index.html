    <h2>Over 24,000 different cellphones and tablets and iDevices run a web browser ...</h2>
    <h2>And your responsive design has to look great on all of them.</h2>

<div class="body">
  <p>You can't create a Photoshop comp for every possible screen your design will run on. So what tool do you use? How do you work with developers?</p>
  
  <p>If you talk to your local, bearded web design guru he'll tell you the problem is solved if you <em>design in the browser</em>.</p>

  <p>Easier said than done.</p>
  
  <h3>
    CSS was made for developers not designers, and it shows.
  </h3>

  <p>You are so much faster at creating designs in Photoshop or Sketch. When you sit down to write code AND design, it feels like you need two separate brains.</p>

  <p>Is designing in the browser even possible for you?</p>

  <h2>
    Do you have to be a magical Unicorn to write CSS as quickly as you design in Photoshop?
  </h2>

<h3>
NOPE! Magical Unicorn skills are not required.
</h3>

<p>
When you're in Photoshop or sketch, you get the layout you want with a click-and-drag of the mouse. In the browser you need floats and position: absolute; margin-left: -9999px; and other yuckiness. 
</p>

<p>
  But have you heard of flexbox? Do you know how to create and use a grid?
</p>
<h3>
  With the right approach these tools massively simplify getting your layout right with CSS.
</h3>
<p>
  The tools developers use to speed up programming can be used by designers to speed up prototyping in the browser &mdash; but you have to pick and choose only the pieces that are useful to you as a designer.
</p>

<h3>
  That's why this free course is made for YOU, and not for developers.
</h3>

<p>
  In this course you will learn:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to use muscle memory to your advantage while you're coding</li>  
  <li>How to create a giant undo button for your projects</li>
  <li>How to mark up a document quickly</li>
  <li>How to slice and dice your design with expert precision</li>
  <li>How to make site-wide changes in one line of CSS</li>
  <li>The best approaches to getting the layout you want in the browser</li>
</ul>
